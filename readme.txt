This is a code generation tool to make signatures.

It takes as input a graphical representation of your name, and
generates a minimal c line of code to generate the input

This is for craig:
main(i){char*_="NGg\\cabBUHcADEjcA\\^EcATDjLcaRBUHcNQarAc";while
(i=*_++)for(;i>1;printf(i-99?i&1?"[]":" ":(i=0,"\n")),i/=2);}
